# hello-world
My very first repository
Hi there!  
This is Kelli here!  I'm trying to learn coding on my own and this is the first time I've tried to use Github.  I live in Southern California and am the mother to 3 children.  Currently practicing HTML5, CSS3 , bootstrap and JavaScript is next on the list.  I'm hoping to eventually feel comfortable enough to do freelance work on the side
